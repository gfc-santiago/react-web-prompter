##Verse 1
Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!

Early in the morning
our song shall rise to thee.

Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty,

God in three persons,
blessed Trinity!

##Verse 2
Holy, holy, holy!
All the saints adore thee

casting down their golden
crowns around the glassy sea

cherubim and seraphim
falling down before thee

which wert, and art,
and evermore shalt be.

##Verse 3
Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide thee,

though the eye of sinful man
thy glory may not see,

only thou art holy;
there is none beside thee,

perfect in power,
in love and purity.

##Verse 4
Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!

All thy works shall 
praise thy name,
in earth and sky and sea.

Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty,

God in three persons,
blessed Trinity.

##Scripture Reading
{V}Matthew 19:23-30
Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
“Truly I tell you, it is hard
for someone who is rich to 
enter the kingdom of heaven.

Again I tell you, it is 
easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle
than for someone who is rich to
enter the kingdom of God.”

When the disciples heard this,
they were greatly astonished and
asked, “Who then can be saved?”
Jesus looked at them and said,
“With man this is impossible, but
with God all things are possible.”

Peter answered him, “We have
left everything to follow you! What
then will there be for us?” 

Jesus said to them,
And everyone who has left
houses or brothers or sisters or
father or mother or wife or
children or fields for my sake

will receive a hundred times as much
and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be
last, and many who are last will be
first.
